#### Introduction

Fermentation is a process in which bacteria, yeast, or other microorganisms break down carbohydrates and sugars in food, resulting in the production of lactic acid and other beneficial compounds. Fermented foods and plants have been used in traditional medicine as a way to ingest probiotics.

In fact, many traditional cultures have used fermented foods for centuries as a way to preserve food and enhance its nutritional value. Some common examples of fermented foods are yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, tempeh, and kombucha. These fermented foods are often rich in beneficial bacteria and yeasts, which can help promote a healthy gut microbiome and aid in digestion. There is some evidence that fermented foods, when consumed regularly as part of a balanced diet, may help improve overall health and well-being.

In addition to **fermented foods**, traditional medicine has used fermented plants as a way to ingest **probiotics**. For example, some cultures use fermented herbs and roots to make tonics or teas that are believed to support gut health and boost the immune system.

Overall, fermented foods and plants can be a valuable source of probiotics and other beneficial compounds, and they continue to be used in traditional medicine and culinary practices around the world.

#### Traditional medicine

In traditional Greco-Roman medicine, described in detail by **Dioscorides** in his work "De Materia Medica," it was common to use various fermented foods and plants as remedies for certain diseases. For example, the use of fermented milk, known as "oxygala," was recommended for the treatment of digestive problems and fever. Dioscorides also suggests the use of fermented barley, known as "zuthos," for the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery. Other fermented foods and plants used in ancient traditional medicine include wine, vinegar, and some herbs and roots left to ferment. These remedies were believed to have various medicinal properties.

Fermentation has a long history in Chinese culture, and fermented foods such as soy sauce, vinegar, and pickles are commonly used in Chinese cuisine. In **Traditional Chinese Medicine** (TCM), fermented foods and plants are used as remedies for certain diseases; in fact, fermented foods and plants are believed to have various health benefits. For example, fermented soy products such as tofu and tempeh are said to tone the spleen and stomach, improve digestion, and regulate blood sugar levels. Fermented black garlic is believed to have anti-inflammatory properties and is often used to treat cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. Other fermented foods and plants used in TCM include fermented tea (pu-erh tea), fermented medicinal mushrooms, and fermented herbs such as ginseng and astragalus. These remedies are believed to help strengthen the immune system, improve digestion, and treat a variety of diseases.

In traditional Indian medicine known as **Ayurveda**, a system of holistic medicine that originated in India more than 3,000 years ago and is still widely practiced today, fermented foods and plants are used as remedies for certain diseases. For example, fermented dairy products such as yogurt and buttermilk are believed to improve digestion, strengthen the immune system, and promote overall health. Fermented foods such as pickles and chutneys are believed to aid digestion and provide beneficial bacteria for the gut microbiome. Fermented herbs and spices are also used in Ayurveda, such as fermented ginger, garlic, and turmeric. These fermented herbs and spices are believed to have greater medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory effects. Ayurvedic physicians may also use fermented herbs and plants in the form of medicinal preparations such as fermented decoctions (kashaya) and fermented infusions (asavas and arishtas) to treat various ailments.

**Modern medicine**

Fermented foods continue to play a role in modern medicine and are considered a valuable source of probiotics and other beneficial compounds. While probiotic supplements have become increasingly popular in recent years, fermented foods are a natural and convenient way to get probiotics and other beneficial compounds. In fact, some studies suggest that fermented foods may be even more effective at promoting gut health than probiotic supplements. This is because fermented foods not only provide beneficial bacteria, but also contain other nutrients and compounds that promote gut health, such as fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants.
